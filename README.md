# PlasmaJS Quick-start Package

This is a repository to help you boost making a ProtonJS project. We have all the dependencies in here, as well as some recommended features. This can make either a single-page web application, or you can make it with ProtonJS, a sister product of Plasma. Refer to the docs folder to learn more.
